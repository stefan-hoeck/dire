/** `Node`s are used to set up the dependency graph between
  * reactive components. They should be an implementation
  * detail invisible to clients of the library.
  *
  * If a reactive component fires an event, its node and all
  * child nodes are marked as dirty, meaning they need to be
  * reevaluated. The event firing node then asks all child
  * nodes to update their state. A node is only recalculated,
  * if none of its parents are still dirty. This guarantees,
  * that during a single reevaluation cycle each dirty node is
  * recalculated exactly once. During reevaluation, all nodes
  * set their state back to non-dirty. After that follows
  * the cleanup phase, during which all nodes are 
  * being asked to clean themselves up.
  * The cleanup phase is needed for event streams to release intermediary
  * results of calculations for garbage collection
  *
  * @TODO: With the new implementation of event streams we
  *        probably can get rid of the cleanup phase altogether.
  *        I think, I'll keep it here for some time but if no
  *        use case shows up, it can be safely removed.
